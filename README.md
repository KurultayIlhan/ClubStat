# ClubStat
Hi, im Ilhan Kurultay and this is my project ClubStat.
Before we start CLubStat is an app that enables players to record their location and speed to evolve and toi become future good players.
The app has 2 kinds of profiles wich is the player first and coach second.
Don't forget the app uses the Identity Management System (IMS). So only the admin is able to make accounts. The reason for using this system is to avoid people making fake profiles to cheat on the games. Each season will the Clubs that want to paerticipate send an nmail with the players and pictures and withc the easy way that the app lets you can you add the playersn,coaches, change passwords, get their stats in swagger: https://ilhankurultay-001-site1.btempurl.com/swagger/index.html.

## Getting started
To start using ClubStat you have to copy the repository to your computer. The most used way is putting it in this directory: C:\Users\{your user}\source\. Here it will be structured and will not get lost.
To open the sourcecode you can use Visual Studio(Wich i recomend).
Open the solution and you will see that there are 8 folders.
1: ClubStat.Infrastructure
2: ClubStat.Infrastructure.Tests
3: ClubStat.RestServer
4: ClubStat.RestServerTests
5: ClubStatDataBase
